			I’m excited to announce the beta launch of LearnTerms v2, the next major evolution of our
			study platform. Over the holiday break, I began building something I believe will
			significantly enhance our learning experience. This release introduces powerful updates
			tailored specifically for our class, offering tools to help us master pharmacology material
			and prepare for exams with confidence and precision. Here’s a quick rundown of what’s new and
			what’s coming as we roll out LearnTerms v2 over the semester:
		</p>

		<h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">The New Exam Module</h2>

		<p class="mt-2">
			The LearnTerms exam module is designed to help us become comfortable with the exam software we
			use in class. It mirrors almost every feature of the Examplify software, providing a seamless
			transition from practice to the real exam experience. This tool comes equipped with a
			beautiful and intuitive interface, making it easy to navigate and answer practice questions
			efficiently. This feature is already live and available, so you can start practicing today.
			Think of it as your test-day rehearsal, complete with all the essential elements of the real
			thing, helping you build confidence and reduce anxiety.

		<h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">AI-Powered Question Generation</h2>

		<p class="mt-10">
			This is where things get really exciting. I’ve integrated advanced AI into LearnTerms to
			create a pipeline that generates custom questions. What makes this different? Unlike generic
			question banks, these questions are built by AI with a deep understanding of our specific
			class material. The process isn’t just about cranking out questions; it’s about ensuring each
			one is high yield and truly helps prepare you for what you’ll see on test day. We’re talking
			complex AI combined with rigorous validation to make sure the content is accurate and
			relevant. This feature is still in beta, but I plan to have it fully ready for production by
			mid-February. In the meantime, your feedback will be invaluable in refining it.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">New Study Features: Built by Students, for Students</h2>

		<p class="mt-10">
			Last year’s class offered incredible input, and I’m building on that to include even more ways
			to study effectively. LearnTerms v2 will soon feature:
		</p>
		<ul class="m-8 mt-4">
			<li>Exclusive flashcards tailored to our coursework</li>
			<li>Supplemental content to reinforce your understanding</li>
			<li>Crowd sourced information to get you ready for assessments</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="mt-10">
			These features are in the pipeline and will roll out incrementally throughout the semester. My
			goal is to give you tools that don’t just help you memorize but actually make the material
			stick.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold">How You Can Help</h2>

		<p class="mt-10">
			Your input during this beta phase is crucial. Whether you spot a bug, have an idea for
			improvement, or just want to share what’s working for you, I’m here to listen. Together, we
			can make LearnTerms v2 a tool that supports all of us—not just this semester but potentially
			for semesters to come. This is just the beginning of a new chapter for LearnTerms. It’s
			evolving from a simple flashcard app to a comprehensive learning platform, and I’m so grateful
			to have you all along for the journey.
