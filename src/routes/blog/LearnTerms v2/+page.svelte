				<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
					Welcome to the launch of <strong>LearnTerms v2</strong> – a revolutionary upgrade designed
					to transform your exam preparation. With smarter study tools and an AI-powered backend, LearnTerms
					v2 is set to become the go-to platform for our class. In this post, we'll walk you through
					the evolution of the platform, explain the technology behind the upgrade, and show you how
					these changes will make your study sessions more efficient and effective.
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- Background & The Problem -->
			<section>
				<h2 class="mb-6 text-4xl font-bold /90">Background &amp; The Problem</h2>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">Background</h3>
				<p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
					LearnTerms began as a focused solution addressing a specific challenge in a single course.
					By concentrating our efforts on a niche area, we were able to create a lightweight and
					user-friendly service with minimal barriers to entry. However, as our user base grew and
					expectations increased, the limitations of the original version became apparent.
				</p>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">The Problem</h3>
				<ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3 text-lg">
					<li class="leading-relaxed">
						<strong>Limited Scope:</strong> The previous version was confined to a single class, which
						restricted its potential.
					</li>
					<li class="leading-relaxed">
						<strong>Manual Verification:</strong> A significant amount of manual effort was required
						to verify terms and maintain accuracy, consuming countless hours.
					</li>
					<li class="leading-relaxed">
						<strong>Scalability Challenges:</strong> The system needed to evolve to accommodate a broader
						range of content while still delivering a high-quality user experience.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
					These challenges highlighted the need for a robust, scalable solution that would automate
					and streamline study material generation.
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- The Evolution -->
			<section>
				<h2 class="mb-6 text-4xl font-bold /90">The Evolution: What's New in LearnTerms v2</h2>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">Vision for v2</h3>
				<p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
					LearnTerms v2 is built with three clear objectives:
				</p>
				<ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3 text-lg">

					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
					Feedback from our beta phase was critical in shaping these upgrades, ensuring that each
					new feature addresses real-world study challenges.
				</p>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">User Benefits</h3>
				<ul class="mb-6 ml-6 space-y-3 text-lg">

					Harnessing the Power of AI for Personalized Learning
				</h2>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">Introduction to AI Integration</h3>
				<p class="mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
					LearnTerms v2 leverages advanced <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> to generate
					personalized study questions quickly and accurately. By fine-tuning these models and utilizing
					effective prompt engineering, we ensure that every generated question is both relevant and
					accurate.
				</p>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">The AI Workflow</h3>
				<ol class="mb-8 ml-6 space-y-6 text-lg">
					<li>
						<strong class="block mb-2 text-lg">Define the Task:</strong>
						<p class="leading-relaxed">
							Clear instructions guide the model on what is expected. For example, a prompt might
							direct the model to generate diverse question types that challenge understanding and
							critical thinking.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong class="block mb-2 text-lg">Specify the Format:</strong>
						<p class="mb-2 leading-relaxed">
							We provide an exact format for the questions, including:
						</p>
						<ul class="mb-4 ml-6 space-y-2">
							<li>A numbered question format</li>
							<li>Multiple-choice options</li>
							<li>
								An explanation section that details why certain options are correct or incorrect
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="mb-2 italic">Example Prompt Block:</p>
						<pre class="bg-base-300 p-6 rounded-lg text-sm overflow-x-auto mb-4">
"You are a pharmacology expert tasked with creating diverse question types
to help students master clinically relevant material. Generate 10 questions
based on the provided material. The questions should challenge understanding,
application, and critical thinking. Make sure that some questions have
multiple answers."
            </pre>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong class="block mb-2 text-lg">Provide the Content:</strong>
						<p class="leading-relaxed">
							The model receives a comprehensive "context dump" of relevant material—from textbook
							excerpts to lecture notes—ensuring it has the necessary information to generate

						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">Validation Process</h3>
				<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
					After the questions are generated, a secondary AI validation step checks the accuracy and
					logic of each question. With an accuracy rate of approximately <strong>95%</strong>, only
					about 5 out of every 100 questions may need revision. This dual-layered approach
					guarantees reliable study materials.
