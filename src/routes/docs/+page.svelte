<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="lead">LearnTerms helps you study faster and smarter—without needing a manual.</p>

<p>
	LearnTerms is designed to be intuitive. You don’t need a manual to get started. If you want the
	most high-yield experience, these docs will give you more than just the how. They will explain the
	why. By understanding the principles and intentions behind the platform, you can align with its
	design and get better results from your study time.
</p>

<p>
	LearnTerms is built to save time. Every feature is designed to help you focus on what matters
	most: learning the material that will actually show up in your classes and exams. We remove
	distractions, cut down on clutter, and give you tools that work right away.
</p>

<p>
	You will notice that LearnTerms favors clarity over complexity. There are no endless menus or
	settings to dig through. Instead, you get a small set of powerful tools that work together. The
	goal is to make studying feel natural and keep you in the flow.
</p>

<p>
	LearnTerms is opinionated. We believe in a specific way of studying—one that values focus,
	consistency, and relevance over trying to cover every possible detail. These choices are
	intentional, and they shape every part of the platform.
</p>

<p>If you keep this philosophy in mind while using LearnTerms, you’ll get the most out of it.</p>
