<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="lead">LearnTerms helps you study faster and smarter—without needing a manual.</p>

<p>
  The LearnTerms study platform is designed to be used without an instruction manual: you don’t need documentation to get started. But if you want the most high-yield experience out of the service, reading the docs will reveal you not necessarily with the how but the why of LearnTerms. By understanding the design intentions and ethos of the platform, you can enhance the way you study and get better results.

<p>
  LearnTerms is built to save time. Every feature is designed to help you focus on what matters most: learning the material that will actually show up in your classes and exams. We remove distractions, cut down on clutter, and give you tools that work right away.

<p>
  You will notice that LearnTerms favors clarity over complexity. There are no endless menus or settings to dig through. Instead, you get a small set of powerful tools that work together. The goal is to make studying feel natural and keep you in the flow.
  </p>

<p>
  LearnTerms is opinionated. We believe in a specific way of studying—one that values focus, consistency, and relevance over trying to cover every possible detail. These choices are intentional, and they shape every part of the platform.

<p>
  If you keep this philosophy in mind while using LearnTerms, you’ll get the most out of it.
