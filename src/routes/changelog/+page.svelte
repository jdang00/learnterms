			Over the past few days, LearnTerms v2 has been getting some new features suggested by users
			like you!
		</p>

		<ul class="mt-1 m-8">
			<li>
				LearnTerms now saves user progress for all chapters. (This might still be a little buggy
				from time to time but I will roll fixes as I work on the backend service that supports
				tracking the questions.
			</li>
			<li>Eliminate answers is now fully implemented and working well.</li>

			<li>On show solution, the options now highlight their answer status for quick navigation.</li>
			<li>Added a shuffle button.</li>
			<li>Add a progress bar.</li>
			<li>Fixed bugs on mobile that were introduced on various builds.</li>
			<li>The analytics engine is now swapped out from Posthog to Vercel.</li>
			<li>Sort by flagged</li>
			<li>Sort by incomplete</li>

		</ul>

		<h3 class="text-xl mt-3 font-medium text-base-content">January 21, 2025</h3>
		<p class="ms-2">The fast paced development cycle continutes!</p>

		<ul class="mt-1 m-8">
			<li>Eliminate answers feature added, a neat tool that lets you narrow down your answers</li>
			<li>
				When implementing eliminate answers, I broke like 12 things. Then I fixed it, pushed the
				changes into production the night everyone is trying to study for the quiz, and then broke
				15 other things. THIS IS WHY YOU DO NOT PUSH BREAKING CHANGES ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM.
			</li>
			<li>Fixed breaking bugs, now should function as expected.</li>
			<li>Blur resets on question change.</li>
			<li>
				Use escape to clear, enter to check, tab to reveal solution, and arrows keys to navigate
				questions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Began implementation for saved progress on questions per user. This is a rather complex
				feature and will rollout closer to the weekend. After extended testing and implementation.
			</li>
