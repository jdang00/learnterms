				LearnTerms’s mission is to help students achieve mastery faster by turning dense course
				materials into clear, targeted, and class-aligned study experiences. We want to empower
				students to learn through a framework that is consistent, collaborative, and contextual,
				while reducing the noise and building for the future.

				My name is Justin Dang, and I’m a full time student at the Northeastern State University
				Oklahoma College of Optometry. I’m the solo developer on LearnTerms, building and spreading
				its message in my free time. While working for my undergraduate degree in computer science,
				I studied AI and human computer interaction. When I came to optometry school, the content
				and pace of learning was dramatically different than anything I was used to. Because of
				this, I started building tools for myself to make digesting and comprehending classes a
				little easier. After sharing these tools with the class, LearnTerms was born and its goal of
				helping students still persists stronger than ever.

			<p>
				The speed and scope of higher education, especially in healthcare programs, is relentless
				and vast. New topics stack on each other before the last ones have a chance to stick. Notes
				pile up in shared drives, PDF libraries, endless slideshows. The tools that students rely on
				are either too broad to match the class sequence or too scattered to build lasting mastery.
				The result is students spending precious hours sifting through clutter instead of deeply
				engaging with learning that actually matters. So LearnTerms was born out of this frustration
				and waste. The platform runs on the belief that studying should be targeted, not tedious.
				Its tools exist to strip away noise, break complex material into meaningful, digestible
				chunks, and give learners a clear path from <em>I’ve seen this before”</em> to
				<em>“I can explain it without notes”</em>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>
				Another important reason this platform exists is that it believes learning is better in
				community. Cohorts, when given the right structure, can move as a unit: sharing insights,
				closing gaps, and raising the floor for everyone. LearnTerms builds for that dynamic from
				the ground up, giving programs the tools to structure content the way you understand it in
				school: semesters, classes, modules. This allows students to see exactly what they need,
				exactly when they need it.

			<h2>How LearnTerms is built</h2>
			<p>
				The product philosophy is practical and opinionated. The best tools are the ones that solve
				your problems while being something you actually want to use. I have 5 core pillars for
				development:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Simplicity is scalable:</strong> I start simple and add complexity only when it buys
					real learning value.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learner first design:</strong> Every experience answers: “What should I do next to
					learn faster?”
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Evidence over hype:</strong> AI and new tech are tools, not a pitch. I test, measure,
					and keep what works.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Clarity beats cleverness:</strong> Language, UI, and user experience should be boringly
					clear.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Fast and adaptive:</strong> Rolling releases help make the site better, so that micro
					enhancements add up to huge improvements over time.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
			<p>
				LearnTerms started as a personal solution to a problem I faced every day. It’s grown into a
				platform that can help entire cohorts work smarter. Every update, feature, and design comes
				back to a single question: <em
					>Will this help students master their material faster and with more confidence?</em
				>
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>My Commitment</h2>
			<p>
				Unlike virtually every study tool that you get to choose to use, I’m not some big corporate
				company or a big group of people working on this. My intention is to continue listening to
				students, testing ideas in the real classroom, and not building things that don’t directly
				serve learning. The goal isn’t to be the biggest study platform. It’s to be the most
				effective.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>An Invitation</h2>
			<p>
				If you’re a student, educator, or program/cohort leader, I invite you to explore LearnTerms
				and see how it can fit into your workflow. Share your feedback, and challenge the ideas.
				Help shape a tool that’s built for your reality, not for some marketing page.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>
				At the end of the day, I see LearnTerms as more than flashcards and question banks. It’s
				about creating something that empowers peers to focus, gain clarity, and treat mastery as a
				habit, not a hope.
