				LearnTerms exists to fix a simple problem: studying for high-volume classes is messy. Our
				mission is to take dense, scattered course materials and turn them into a study experience
				that actually matches your class schedule. No noise, just the content you need to know,
				organized the way you need to learn it.

				My name is Justin Dang. I’m a full-time student at the Northeastern State University
				Oklahoma College of Optometry and the solo developer behind LearnTerms. Before this, I
				studied Computer Science, focusing on AI and Human-Computer Interaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I started optometry school, the sheer volume of information hit me hard. The pace was
				completely different from undergrad. I realized I needed a better way to keep up, so I
				started coding tools to help me digest my own lectures. I shared them with a few classmates,
				and eventually, LearnTerms was born.

			<p>
				In healthcare programs, new topics stack up before you’ve even finished the previous ones.
				We deal with endless slideshows, shared drives, and PDF libraries. The generic study tools
				out there are either too broad or too disorganized to handle that specific curriculum
				structure.
			</p>
			<p>
				I found myself spending hours just organizing files instead of actually learning. I built
				LearnTerms to stop that waste. The platform strips away the clutter and breaks complex
				material into digestible chunks. The goal is to create a clear path from <em
					>"I've seen this slide"</em
				>
				to <em>"I can explain this concept without looking."</em>
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>
				I also believe that no one should study alone. When a cohort has the right structure,
				everyone lifts each other up. If one person figures out a concept, everyone should benefit.
				LearnTerms mirrors the way we actually go through school—by semesters, classes, and
				modules—so you see exactly what you need, right when the professor is teaching it.

			<h2>How It's Built</h2>
			<p>
				My philosophy is practical. The best tools are the ones that get out of your way. I follow 5
				core pillars:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Simplicity scales:</strong> I start simple. I only add complexity if it actually helps
					you learn better.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learner-first design:</strong> Every feature answers one question: “Does this help
					me learn faster?”
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Evidence over hype:</strong> AI is a tool, not a sales pitch. I test features myself;
					if they don't work, I cut them.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Clarity beats cleverness:</strong> The interface should be boringly clear. You're here
					to study, not figure out a UI.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Fast and adaptive:</strong> I push updates constantly. Small tweaks add up to huge
					improvements over time.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
			<p>
				LearnTerms started as a hack to solve my own problem. It has grown into a platform that
				helps entire cohorts work smarter. Every update comes back to that single goal: helping us
				master material faster so we can be better practitioners.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>My Commitment</h2>
			<p>
				Unlike most study tools, this isn't run by a big corporation or a VC-backed team. It’s just
				me. My commitment is to keep listening to students and testing ideas in real classrooms. I’m
				not trying to be the biggest platform; I’m trying to be the most effective one.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>An Invitation</h2>
			<p>
				If you’re a student, educator, or cohort leader, give LearnTerms a try. See how it fits into
				your workflow. If you have feedback, tell me. You can help shape a tool built for our
				reality, not just another marketing page.
