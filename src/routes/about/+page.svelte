			<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>
					Nope. Not even close. Technically the most efficent way to study is active recall coupled
					with spaced repetition. Medical students do this with Anki. <a

						This study

					and effective way to study. Daily discipline of reviewing decks is key.

			<div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">So why use LearnTerms?</div>
			<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>
					LearnTerms uses the same underlying principles of active recall and spaced repition as
					Anki. But for 4101 Introduction to Optometry, the quizzes are fill in the blank will no
					room for spelling error. This is where typing it out comes in handy. Plus, the terms lists
					made for the site are extremely comprehensive and get updated weekly.

			<div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">Why can't I just use Quizlet or Anki?</div>
			<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>
					You can use both. But using LearnTerms means you don't have to put up with several
					problems the other services have. Quizlet is a heavy and ad-ridden website that tries to
					do everything. You'll have to pay for Quizlet+ for some features. With LearnTerms, all
					features are free forever and new feature requests can be made with a turnaround time of
					just a few days. Anki is great but requires a lot of setup and isn't really that pretty.
					LearnTerms is a custom made solution, ready to go out of the box, and beautiful desiged
					with modern web accessibility standards in mind. If you want to learn Intro terms, you use
					LearnTerms.
