			<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>
					LearnTerms was born out of a challenge faced by our class in 4001 Introduction to
					Optometry, a one hour credit course in the NSUOCO first year curriculum. The weekly
					medical terminology quizzes presented three critical obstacles:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
					<li>Overwhelming Vocabulary: Each week's term list exceeded 150 words.</li>
					<li>Spelling Precision: Quizzes demanded exact spelling and specific combining forms.</li>
					<li>
						Inefficient Study Methods: Self-guided preparation often led to long hours with limited
						success.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-3">
					LearnTerms was designed to solve these challenges through condensed learning, spelling
					mastery, and efficient studying. Today, it has evolved into a powerful study platform that
					leverages technology and collaboration to help you confidently prepare for your
					assessments.

			<div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">Why should I use LearnTerms?</div>
			<div class="collapse-content">
				<p>
					We understand that there are numerous study tools available, from Quizlet to Anki. What
					sets LearnTerms apart are its custom-built features designed specifically for your
					success:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
					<li>
						Smart Algorithms: We use predictive models to highlight the terms and questions most
						likely to appear on your quizzes and exams.
					</li>
					<li>
						AI-Powered Tools: Our backend leverages large language models trained on course content,
						providing a level of specificity that's hard to find elsewhere.
					</li>
					<li>
						Integrated Learning: LearnTerms complements your existing study methods, blending active
						recall, spaced repetition, and targeted practice to help you excel.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-3">
					Rather than replace your current tools, LearnTerms enhances your learning experience,
					giving you a better chance at acing your tests.
