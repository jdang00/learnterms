# September LearnTerms Bug Fixes

This document captures the immediate September bug fixes with two views for each change:

- Technical: process, iterations, and implementation details
- General: user-facing explanation suitable for changelogs

---

## 1) Filter behavior: “Show Incomplete” and “Show Flagged”

### Technical
- Correctness and solution styling are now derived from the currently filtered question rather than the unfiltered list. We updated `QuizState.isCorrect` to reference `getCurrentFilteredQuestion() || getCurrentQuestion()` so filtered views preserve correct/incorrect visuals.
- Filtering remains display-only; we never mutate question data. Filters are computed by `QuizState.getFilteredQuestions()` using `liveFlaggedQuestions` and `liveInteractedQuestions`.
- We retained stable navigation when toggling filters by recovering the best matching index after a filter change.
- Defined simple interplay: in “Show Incomplete”, flagging a question does not immediately remove it. A question leaves the incomplete view only after the user interacts (selects/eliminates). This keeps the UI predictable and reactive without surprise jumps.
- Key files: `src/routes/classes/[classId]/modules/[moduleId]/states.svelte.ts`, `src/lib/components/MainQuiz.svelte`, `src/routes/classes/[classId]/modules/[moduleId]/+page.svelte`.

### General
- Filtering by “Incomplete” or “Flagged” no longer removes correct answer markings or breaks solution visuals.
- Questions don’t jump unexpectedly while you flag during an “Incomplete” review; things stay stable and predictable.
- Navigation, progress, and solution indicators work the same in filtered and unfiltered views.

## 2) Answer reconciliation when backend changes

### Technical
- Added `sanitizeStateForCurrentQuestion()` in `QuizState` to prune any stale `selectedAnswers`/`eliminatedAnswers` that no longer exist after backend updates to options/correct answers.
- Call sites:
  - Before saving progress (ensures only valid option ids are persisted)
  - After loading progress (ensures client state aligns with latest server options)
- Removed an earlier attempt to sanitize within `setQuestions` to avoid reactive write loops (`UpdatedAtError` and `effect_update_depth_exceeded`). Keeping sanitization only pre-save and post-load avoids the loop and ensures consistency.
- Impact: client gracefully adapts when authors edit option ids or correct answers.
- Key files: `states.svelte.ts` (new sanitizer), module `+page.svelte` (call sites).

### General
- When content is updated on the backend, the quiz automatically adapts—no more “ghost” choices or mismatched answers.
- Your saved selections remain valid, and you won’t see confusing UI after authors tweak questions.

## 3) Persist user preferences across modules (Auto-next, Shuffle options)

### Technical
- Persisted preferences to `localStorage`:
  - `lt:autoNextEnabled` (default true)
  - `lt:optionsShuffleEnabled` (default false)
- Exposed `loadUserPreferencesFromStorage()` in `QuizState` and initialized it once in the module `+page.svelte`.
- Toggling settings updates storage immediately via `setAutoNextEnabled` and `setOptionsShuffleEnabled`.
- Kept defaults unchanged for first-time users; storage only overrides when keys exist.
- Key files: `states.svelte.ts`, module `+page.svelte`, `SettingsModal.svelte` (existing UI).

### General
- Your preference for auto-advancing and shuffled options now sticks across modules and sessions—set it once, it stays that way.
- Defaults remain the same: auto-next on, shuffle off.

---

## 4) Keyboard shortcuts for fast option selection

### Technical
- Added number key handling in the existing keydown switch within the module `+page.svelte`:
  - Keys `1–0` map to options `A–J` according to the current ordered options (respects shuffle).
  - Disabled in Fill-in-the-Blank and when the solution is revealed.
  - Uses `qs.toggleOption()` and schedules a save via `qs.scheduleSave()`.
- Updated the shortcuts hint in `SettingsModal.svelte` to reflect the new selection shortcut.

### General
- You can now press number keys `1–0` to select options quickly (A–J). It works with shuffled answers and doesn’t interfere with fill-in-the-blank.
- Keyboard-first studying feels faster and more fluid.

## 5) Remove unused class progress refresh subscription

### Technical
- Searched for all usages of `getProgressForClass`. Found a single reactive subscription on `src/routes/classes/+page.svelte` that wasn’t used for display.
- Removed the live `useQuery(api.userProgress.getProgressForClass, ...)` subscription and its unused type import to avoid unnecessary bandwidth and refresh churn.
- Left the backend function intact for future features (e.g., dedicated Class Progress module).

### General
- The classes dashboard no longer fetches background progress that isn’t shown, improving responsiveness and reducing network usage.
- This cleans things up now while keeping the door open for a richer class progress view later.

---

## Notes
- All changes preserve existing defaults and UI patterns (DaisyUI, Svelte 5 runes), focus on minimal surface area, and favor the database as the source of truth.
- Lints are clean in changed files; reactivity loops were avoided by moving sanitization to safe points.
