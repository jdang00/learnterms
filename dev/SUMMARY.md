# LearnTerms: The "Always-Live" Study Platform

## Why This Isn't Just Another Quiz App

Most study tools are static. You load a page, take a quiz, and hope your internet doesn't blink. LearnTerms is built on a **real-time engine** (Convex) that syncs every click, flag, and answer instantly.

It’s designed for the high-performance student workflow: **fast, surgical, and distraction-free.**

## ⚡ The "Live" Advantage
*Powered by Convex & Svelte 5*

- **Instant Progress Sync**: Your progress saves the millisecond you interact. Close the tab, switch devices, or lose Wi-Fi? You pick up *exactly* where you left off.
- **Live Content Updates**: If a professor or curator fixes a typo while you're studying, the question updates on your screen instantly—no refresh required.
- **Cross-Device State**: Start a session on your laptop, finish it on your phone. Your flags, eliminated options, and selected answers are identical everywhere.

## 🎯 Surgical Study Controls
*Don't waste time on what you already know.*

Stop retaking the same 50-question quiz just to practice the 3 you got wrong. LearnTerms provides granular filters inside every module:

- **Review Mode**: Toggle "Show Flagged" or "Show Incomplete" to focus only on your weak spots.
- **Elimination Strategy**: Cross out distractors just like on a real exam. We save your eliminations so they persist if you come back later.
- **Keyboard Power**: Navigate (`Arrows`), select answers (`1-9`), flag (`F`), shuffle (`Shift+S`), and reveal solutions (`Tab`) without touching your mouse.
- **Focus Mode**: One-tap fullscreen removes all UI clutter so you can lock in.

## 🧠 Syllabus-Aware Intelligence
*Powered by Gemini Pro*

Generic AI flashcards are often irrelevant. LearnTerms generates content directly from **your course materials**.

- **Source-Based Generation**: Questions are created from your specific lecture notes and PDFs, ensuring they match your exam content.
- **Varied Question Formats**:
    - **Multiple Choice**: Standard exam format.
    - **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Tests true recall (typing the answer) vs. passive recognition.
    - **Matching**: efficient testing of definitions and relationships.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Every question includes a "Why?" breakdown to reinforce the concept.

## 📊 Academic Tools
- **Grade Calculator**: A built-in tool to track your standing across courses. Input your syllabus components (exams, assignments) to see exactly what you need to score to get your target grade.
