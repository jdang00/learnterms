## The Admin Workflow: From 0 to 100

LearnTerms provides a comprehensive suite of tools for instructors and administrators to create a complete learning experience for their students. This workflow allows an admin to take a class from zero (no content) to one hundred (a complete set of study materials and practice questions).

1.  **Create a Class**: An admin creates a new class for a specific semester, complete with a name, code, and description.
2.  **Add Documents to the Content Library**: The admin uploads or creates documents in the Content Library. These documents serve as the source material for the class, and can be anything from lecture notes and slides to articles and textbook chapters.
3.  **Create Modules**: The admin organizes the class into modules, which can represent weeks, topics, or any other logical division of the course material.
4.  **Generate Questions in the Question Studio**: The admin uses the Question Studio to generate questions from the documents in the Content Library. They can select specific sections of a document to create highly targeted questions.
5.  **Assign Questions to Modules**: The newly generated questions are then assigned to the appropriate module within the class.
6.  **Students Ready to Study**: With the class structured, the content in place, and the questions generated, students can immediately begin studying, practicing, and mastering the course material.
