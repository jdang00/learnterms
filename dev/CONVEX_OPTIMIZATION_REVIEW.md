# Convex Optimization Review and Update

This document outlines the recent optimizations made to the Convex schema and queries to improve the overall performance of the application.

## Summary of Changes

The following changes were made to the Convex schema and queries:

### Schema Changes (`src/convex/schema.ts`)

- **`class` table:** Added an index on `cohortId`.
- **`userProgress` table:** Added a `classId` field and a compound index on `[userId, classId]`.
- **`contentLib` table:** Added an index on `cohortId`.
- **`chunkContent` table:** Added an index on `documentId`.
- **`question` table:** Added a compound index on `['moduleId', 'order']`.

### Query Changes

- **`userProgress.ts`**:
    - `saveUserProgress` mutation was updated to include the `classId`.
    - `getProgressForClass` query was updated to use the new `by_user_class` index.
- **`class.ts`**:
    - `getUserClasses`, `getClassContentCounts`, `updateClassOrder`, `insertClass`, `deleteClass`, and `updateClass` were updated to use the `by_cohortId` index.
- **`module.ts`**:
    - `getClassModules`, `getAdminModule`, `getAdminModulesWithQuestionCounts`, `updateModuleOrder`, `insertModule`, and `updateModule` were updated to use the `by_classId` index.
- **`question.ts`**:
    - `getFirstQuestionInModule` was updated to use the new `by_moduleId_order` index.
- **`contentLib.ts`**:
    - `getContentLibByCohort` was updated to use the `by_cohortId` index.
- **`chunkContent.ts`**:
    - `getChunkByDocumentId` was updated to use the `by_documentId` index.

## Why the New Approach is Better

The previous implementation of the queries often relied on filtering through all documents in a table to find the ones that matched the specified criteria. This approach is inefficient and can lead to slow query performance, especially as the number of documents in the database grows.

The new approach utilizes Convex indexes to optimize these queries. Here's why this is better:

- **Faster Queries:** Indexes allow Convex to quickly locate the documents that match a query without having to scan the entire table. This results in significantly faster query performance.
- **Reduced Database Load:** By using indexes, we reduce the amount of work the database has to do to fulfill a query. This leads to lower database load and improved overall application performance.
- **Scalability:** As the application grows and the amount of data increases, the performance benefits of using indexes will become even more pronounced. The new approach ensures that the application will remain performant as it scales.

### Example: `getProgressForClass`

The original `getProgressForClass` query was particularly inefficient. It fetched all modules for a class, then all questions for each module, and finally all user progress records for the user. This resulted in multiple round trips to the database and a lot of data being transferred.

The new implementation adds a `classId` to the `userProgress` table and an index on `[userId, classId]`. This allows us to fetch all the user progress records for a given user and class in a single, efficient query. This significantly reduces the complexity and execution time of the query.

By implementing these changes, we have made the application more efficient, scalable, and performant.
