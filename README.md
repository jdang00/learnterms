# LearnTerms

LearnTerms is a free, open-source study tool built to make mastering complex topics easier and faster. Created by the Northeastern State University Oklahoma College of Optometry Class of 2028, it bridges the gap between platforms like Quizlet and Anki with unique, paywall-free features. Whether you're prepping for exams or fine-tuning your knowledge, LearnTerms is flexible, practical, and designed with students in mind.

## Tools

- **Svelte** - We use Svelte because it aligns with our functional first, performance oriented philosophy of developing software. Svelte framework ships minimal JavaScript to the front end and its syntax and coding style to implement reactivity is a joy to write.
- **TailwindCSS** - Modern web devs use TailwindCSS. It provides CSS utility classes and a decent default look while giving fine grain control over everything else.
- **DaisyUI** - LearnTerms ships features first. To help with this, a good looking component library that plays nice with TailwindCSS is essential. We also take heavy advantage of the color system for themes.
- **Convex** - A modern, reactive database that simplifies data management and enables real-time features.
- **Vercel** - Vercel hosts LearnTerms and works with GitHub to deploy the site with every new push. It runs CI/CD, analytics, manages our domains, and serves our AI infrastructure via the AI SDK.

## FAQs

### How did LearnTerms come about?

LearnTerms was born out of a challenge faced by our class in 4001 Introduction to Optometry, a one hour credit course in the NSUOCO first year curriculum. The weekly medical terminology quizzes presented three critical obstacles:

- **Overwhelming Vocabulary**: Each week's term list exceeded 150 words.
- **Spelling Precision**: Quizzes demanded exact spelling and specific combining forms.
- **Inefficient Study Methods**: Self-guided preparation often led to long hours with limited success.

LearnTerms was designed to solve these challenges through condensed learning, spelling mastery, and efficient studying. Today, it has evolved into a powerful study platform that leverages technology and collaboration to help you confidently prepare for your assessments.

### Why use LearnTerms?

We understand that there are numerous study tools available, from Quizlet to Anki. What sets LearnTerms apart are its custom-built features designed specifically for your success:

- **Smart Algorithms**: We use predictive models to highlight the terms and questions most likely to appear on your quizzes and exams.
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Our backend leverages large language models trained on course content, providing a level of specificity that's hard to find elsewhere.
- **Integrated Learning**: LearnTerms complements your existing study methods, blending active recall, spaced repetition, and targeted practice to help you excel.
