# LearnTerms: A Modern, AI-Powered Learning Platform

## Executive Summary

LearnTerms is an advanced learning platform designed to provide a personalized and effective study experience for students. The application is currently undergoing a significant architectural transition, migrating from a legacy system to a modern, scalable infrastructure. This migration involves moving from Supabase to Convex for the database, which will enable more robust and flexible data management.

The new architecture is built around a modular, component-based system using Svelte 5 and Daisy UI, with a strong emphasis on a clean, intuitive user experience. The platform's core functionality is centered around AI-powered question generation and personalized learning paths, which are being actively developed and integrated into the new system.

*   **Personalized Learning Paths**: LearnTerms adapts to each student's learning style, tracking their progress and recommending the most effective study materials and exercises.
*   **Modern, Component-Based UI**: The user interface is built with Svelte 5 and Daisy UI, providing a clean, intuitive, and responsive experience across all devices.
*   **Scalable, Real-Time Backend**: The new backend is powered by Convex, a modern, real-time database that enables seamless data synchronization and a more interactive user experience.
*   **Legacy System**: The legacy system, which is still partially in use, is built on Supabase and provides a foundation for the new architecture.

## Database Migration: From Supabase to Convex

The most significant change in the LearnTerms platform is the migration of the database from Supabase to Convex. This migration is being implemented incrementally, with new features being built on Convex while the legacy system continues to run on Supabase.

### Legacy System (Supabase)

The legacy system is accessible via the `/dashboard` route and is built on Supabase. This system includes the following features:

*   **Pharmacology and Challenge Questions**: The legacy system provides access to a large database of pharmacology and challenge questions, which are being migrated to the new system.
*   **User Progress Tracking**: The legacy system tracks user progress and performance, providing a foundation for the new, more advanced analytics system.

### New Architecture (Convex)

The new architecture is accessible via the `/classes` route and is built on Convex. This system includes the following features:

*   **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: The new system uses Convex to provide real-time data synchronization, enabling a more interactive and collaborative user experience.
*   **Scalable Data Model**: The new data model is designed to be more scalable and flexible, allowing for the addition of new features and functionality in the future.
*   **Modern, Component-Based UI**: The new UI is built with Svelte 5 and Daisy UI, providing a more modern and intuitive user experience.

## User Experience

The LearnTerms user experience is designed to be simple, intuitive, and engaging. The platform's clean, modern interface is optimized for all devices, allowing students to study anytime, anywhere. The new architecture will further enhance the user experience by providing a more interactive and personalized learning environment.
